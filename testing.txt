The driver program I am creating for unit testing should test/verify that the 3 functions I created for my inventory simulation program are working as expected:
1. void displayInventory(const map<string, array<list<string>, 3>> inventory)
2. void inventorySimulation(map<string, array<list<string>, 3>>& inventory, string season, string event, string product, int department)
3. bool checkUpdateInventoryStock(list<string>& department, string product)

For function #1:
We need to ensure that the inventory data is displayed neatly. Each time this function is called, the "current inventory" state should be displayed.
This function's output should include season name and department name. The product names within each department should also be displayed.
If there are no products in stock within a department, an "out of stock" message for the department should be displayed.
The test for this function will ensure that the current inventory is displayed neatly and correctly each time it is called. 
We can perform this test by calling the function after reading from our input file to show successful initial inventory population. 
Then, we can also call the function once again after our simulation occurs to ensure that the inventory state is displayed again, and this time, it will be updated and more current.

For function #2:
We need to ensure that the inventory simulation occurs correctly.
This means that the user should be first notified that an event has occurred. The user should be notified (with a console message) of the event type and its associated season, department, and product.
Our 4 parameters (string season, string event, string product, int department) will be used for this purpose.
After the user is notified of the event, the inventory needs to be updated correctly based on the type of event that has occurred.

For function #3:
This is a helper function that goes hand-in-hand with our inventory simulation function. 
This helper function ensures that a product is in stock within its department before a theft or purchase for that product can occur.
It then erases the first instance of that product within its associated department (an std::list). This means true is returned to our inventory simulation function.
False is returned if the product was not found within the department (which means it cannot be stolen or purchased since it is out of stock).

Additionally, we need to ensure that the code block we have in main() for input file reading is initialzing the inventory with data correctly.
If the input file cannot open successfully, the program should exit. The reason for this is that there is no data to work with if the input file cannot be read from.

Here are some detailed testing notes I have come up with that are easy to follow and will guide the creation of my driver program:

Test #1 -
Check if the input file was read from successfully and the inventory has been correctly initialized with data from the input file.
We can perform this check by using the displayInventory() function after we read from the input file.

Test #2 -
Purchases or thefts should not be allowed when a department has no product in stock.
The user should be notified that there the event was attempted, but is no product to steal/purchase.
We can perform this check by using the inventorySimulation() and checkUpdateInventoryStock() functions in conjunction.

Test #3 -
If a product is stolen or purchased, only 1 of those products should be removed from the inventory (if there are multiple quantities of the same product).
This is done to indicate purchase/theft of ONE item.

For example: 
Season: Fall
    Department - electronics: phone, phone
If a phone is purchased...
Department should update to...
    Department - electronics: phone

We can perform this check by using the checkUpdateInventoryStock() function.

Test #4 -
Products should/can be delivered to departments that are "out of stock". This applies specifically to the "delivery" event.
We can perform this check by using the inventorySimulation() function.

Test #5 -
If a duplicate product is being delivered to "top off" inventory, the product name should show in the department more than once to indicate presence of multiple quantities.
We can perform this check by using the inventorySimulation() function.
