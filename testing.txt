The driver program I am creating for unit testing should test/verify that the 3 functions I created for my inventory simulation program are working as expected:
1. void displayInventory(const map<string, array<list<string>, 3>> inventory)
2. void inventorySimulation(map<string, array<list<string>, 3>>& inventory, string season, string event, string product, int department)
3. bool checkUpdateInventoryStock(list<string>& department, string product)

For function #1:
We need to ensure that the inventory data is displayed neatly. Each time this function is called, the "current inventory" state should be displayed.
This function's output should include season name and department name. The product names within each department should also be displayed.
If there are no products in stock within a department, an "out of stock" message for the department should be displayed.
The test for this function will ensure that the current inventory is displayed neatly and correctly each time it is called. 
We can perform this test by calling the function after reading from our input file to show successful initial inventory population. 
Then, we can also call the function once again after our simulation occurs to ensure that the inventory state is displayed again, and this time, it will be updated and more current.
