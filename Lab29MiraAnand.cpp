// include my program header here
// COMSC-210 | Lab 29 | Mira Anand
// Module 11, Lesson: Software Development Life Cycle, Assignment: Project Proposal, Pseudocode, & Mockup
// IDE used: Visual Studio Code for Mac

// include the necessary headers here
// define namespace (using namespace std;) after including the headers

// include any global const variables here
    // so far, for mockup/wireframe purposes, I am planning on creating a global const dummy variable to hold a product's name

// define function prototypes here
    // planning on having 3 functions
    // 1. to output the contents of the inventory initially and then after each time period occurs
    // 2. to perform the actual inventory simulation
    // 3. a helper function to assist the inventory simulation function (so the inventory simulation function isn't too complex/cluttered)

// int main() function starts here
    // srand(time(0)); needed as first line in main() for randomization - so inventory simulation is more realistic

    // creation of the foundational data structure
    // I need to include detailed comments that explain this data structure piece by piece
